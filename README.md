# SentimentAnalysis
This project details the development of a deep learning model for sentiment analysis. It uses an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network to classify movie reviews from the IMDb dataset as positive or negative, achieving about 87% accuracy. The project covers the full workflow from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

The model is designed for sentiment analysis on movie reviews, using a deep learning approach to classify them as positive or negative.

Project Overview
This project uses an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network to analyze text from the IMDb movie review dataset. It includes the entire workflow from data loading and preprocessing to model training and evaluation. The model achieves approximately 87% accuracy in distinguishing between positive and negative reviews.

Core Components
Technology: The project is built using Python with TensorFlow and Keras.
Dataset: It utilizes the IMDb dataset, which contains 50,000 movie reviews split for training and testing.
Model Architecture: The core of the solution is an LSTM network, which is well-suited for processing sequential data like text.
Preprocessing: To ensure uniformity, all reviews are padded to a length of 256 words.

Key Outcomes
Performance: The model demonstrates strong predictive accuracy on unseen data.
Challenges: Key challenges included preventing the model from overfitting and selecting an appropriate sequence length for the reviews.
Future Work: Potential improvements include using more advanced algorithms like Transformers, incorporating larger datasets, and deploying the model for real-time use.
